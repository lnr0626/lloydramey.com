### Past Projects

- [Kotlin CFN Templates](https://github.com/lnr0626/cfn-templates) - A gradle plugin and kotlin DSL for declaring cloud formation templates.
- [Calculus Review](/resources/calc_review.pdf) - I created this while reviewing for my AP calculus test. It's a fairly comprehensive overview of the topics covered in calc 1 and 2
