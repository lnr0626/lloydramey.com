# Myself

It's difficult for me to figure out what I want to/should say in this section. My
interests and the activities I do vary over time; as do the things I want to write
about. My day job is a Software Engineer, and a lot of the things I find interest
in are somewhat computer related because of that. However, my interests also span
across art, science, random fun facts, fitness, and probably other random things
that I'm forgetting as I write this. I don't have any plans for specific content
on this site; though I'm confident some of it will be technical, some of it cooking
related.

## Projects

Recently I've been bootstraping a project named [Schedule Guru](https://schedule.guru/).
It's scheduling software for local fitness businesses which aims to simplify their
schedule management, and make it easier for clients to register for classes/events.
I'm building with input from a studio near my hometown to solve a number of the
issues we've had with similar software in the past. It's currently operating as a
limited beta; however I hope to open it up to other studios in the near future. If
you're reading this and are interested; please feel free to contact me.

Check out [my projects](projects.md) to see things that I'm currently learning or
working on, and a sampling of things I've worked on in the past.

## Books

I may eventually add a reading list, and start doing book reviews on here. We'll
see. Most of the books I read are fantasy or science fiction; though more recently
I've been finding a number of non-fiction/technical books that pique my interest.
I largely got into fantasy through Robert Jordans Wheel of Time series; and so a
good number of the books I read are in a similar vein. More recently I've been
following Will Wight's Cradle series. If you have any suggestions; please send me
message.
