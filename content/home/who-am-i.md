You know, I've thought a lot about what to write here and I'm still not sure. I can tell you things about myself - e.g. I love the out doors, but don't spend nearly enough time there, I enjoy coding to the point that it distracts me from other things, I'm a Christain who is still trying to figure out how that fits into working as a software engineer. But is that what you're looking for? I don't know, I don't really think anyone but yourself can say for sure. So I'll go for it, and maybe change it again in another couple months. Afterall, can anyone fully describe themselves in a few sentences?

I'm a recent (can you still say recent after 2 years?) graduate from Virginia Tech, currently working for a small company named BTI360. I'm also enrolled in UIUC's online MCS program. In my (limited) free time, I enjoy reading - mostly I read Science Fiction/Fantasy, but every now and then I do venture out into other genres. I want to say that I'm a gamer, but I know that's not true. I used to game, but recently have not had the time (or rather used the time I have in other ways).
