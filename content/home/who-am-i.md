My interests morph over time, but recently I've been diving into food science
(as it relates to home cooking), rock climbing, backpacking, and a few other
things. I occasionally blog about things I've cooked, and infrequently about
things I've coded. A pet peeve of mine is food blogs that bury the lead by
writing a dissertation about things only slightly related to the recipe, and so
I just stick to the recipe and maybe a paragraph describing how it'll taste.

### Career

I am currently a Software Engineer at a small company named BTI360. So far a
majority of my work has been in the search and analytics domains. Within that
area, I have worked on a decently large variety of things - including query
parsers, a percolator like service built on Solr, video analysis pipelines, etc.
My current project is focused on surfacing key pieces of video data to help
users analyze large amounts of video streams quickly; while ensuring that they
don't miss important information.

I work on various other things on the side, I've written about some of my past
projects on my blog - check them out if you're interested.

### Schooling

I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech, and am on
track to graduate this May (2019) with a Masters of Computer Science from UIUC's
online MCS program. I've been pleasantly surprised with the program so far -
I've been able to apply material that I was interested in, but never though I'd
actually have a use for.
