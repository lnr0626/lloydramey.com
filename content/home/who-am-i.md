I am a recent graduate from Virginia Tech. I suppose that 
makes me a Hokie (Go Hokies!), which is kind of cool. 
My time at VT was awesome, but I'm glad to have moved on.
I eventually hope to go to graduate school, but current 
have no idea what to specialize in yet.

I am a software craftsman. I love to write  code, even more
so I love it when I can make the code that I write 
beautiful. I'm currently employed at a small company named
BTI360 spending my days coding away. It's great - I love 
it there. When I'm not at work I enjoy playing around 
with toy projects, or cool new pieces of technology 
(I'm looking at you myo).

I am also a swimmer / biker / runner / climber / general outdoor 
liking person. I have been swimming for more than 15 years
(though not completely consistently throughout those years),
but only recently started the other activities. If I have the
time, I'll go to a local park with my dog for a short walk - 
neither of us have the endurance to go very far, esp. in the
summer humidity.
