Most of my education invovled embedded system design, and low level programming. I enjoy those things, but am currently only interested in them as a hobby. I've writted about some of my projects on my blog -- check them out if you're interested. I keep most of my side projects in private GitLab repos - only private because I don't want to have to maintain them, or manage licensing them.

My current work is fairly standard enterprise stuff, with some interesting twists thrown in. Some of the work I've done in the past may actually make it into Solr, though the JIRA issue has been stagnant for a while.
