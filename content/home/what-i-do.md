As I mentioned before, I code for fun and profit. Currently, my 
projects mostly consist of web development, but that changes
nearly each month - it really just depends on what catches my
interest. Every now and then I get on a spurt of game
development, I've been toying with libGDX for a while - 
mostly because it's such a cool idea. If you haven't heard of 
it, their goal is to develop a game development framework which 
works on quite a number of platforms.
        
Most of my education involved embedded system design, and while at
VT I was involved with the AMP Lab doing an embedded project.
I also attempted to design a solder certification board, though
that did not end up working in the end. If I find the free time,
I would like to continue working on it, but currently have small
hope in that. Embedded is something that I really enjoy, though
currently it's something I'm only interested in as a hobby.

If anyone is actually reading all of this and would like to see
some of what I have done, my 
[github](href='https://github.com/lnr0626') has some of my
work. Not all of it is high quality, and not all of it is finished. 
The code for this site is actually there as well (licensed under 
[Apache v2.0](href='http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html')). 
As a side note, I also have a [blog](href='http://www.anothermakersjourney.com') 
that I update every now and then. I think one of my next projects will be to 
write a new theme for that. Something simple.
